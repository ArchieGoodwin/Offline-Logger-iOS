Offline Logger for iOS
======================

This app is an experiment at gathering data from the iPhone 5s with its new location and motion APIs. The app tracks:
* GPS location
* Motion State (walking, running, driving, stationary)
* Step count

The app gathers data with no network connection and stores locally on disk. The data is sent to the server in a batch when the user chooses.
